## Introduction

A work-in-progress Valheim mod that focuses on further expanding the existing character progression - heavy emphasis on providing a smooth and seamless integration with the existing game mechanics.

## Planned Features

- **PERK SYSTEM** built on top of Valheim's own skill system - adding more depth to skills.
	- **Enhanced vanilla skills:** plenty of perks to choose from!
	- **Conflict-free:** the system is built as an extension to the game. No modifications has been made to the skills themselves, the perk system only reads their values and acts on that.
  - **Data-driven:** easy for everyone to create new perks via YAML files. Know how to code? Create new perk behaviors, unlock- and activation conditions, that can be used in YAML to allow for even more possibilities!
- **NEW SKILLS** that utilizes the perk system.
